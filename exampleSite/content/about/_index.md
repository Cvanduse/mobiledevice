Wake up early. Drink Coffee. Work Hard.

A Detroiter who is inspired by the hustle, loves building things from the rock bottom, and is constantly in search for another cup of coffee. Despite growing up on Motown, I actually prefer listening to Hip Hop and Jazz. Definitely, rooted deep in the Motor City, but I still love to get out and explore different cities and experience new cultures.
